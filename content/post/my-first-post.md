This is my latest attempt to be a frequent blogger and share the knowledge, thoughts and code snippets, whenever possible. I hope this would encourage me in my future endeavors.

In the past, I have tried to use Wordpress for my blog but this time, I wanted to try something different and went with static site generator - [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/ "Hugo"). So far, it's been pretty easy to setup the blog, except for adding new pages, since the theme i have selected is a single page theme - [Cactus Plus](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-cactus-plus).

My recent exploits have been on Kubernetes (k8s) and on learning golang. So, you would see more posts in these areas compared to others.

Follow my journey through this new blog.
