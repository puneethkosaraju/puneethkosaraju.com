Hello, my name is Puneeth Kosaraju. Welcome to my little corner on the world wide web. I’m humbled that you want to learn a little more about me.

I live in Dallas, Texas with my beautiful wife, Chandana and our son, Krishiv. I serve as Senior Software Engineer for DELL EMC.
Come say hello to me on Twitter. I’m [@indianethic](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=indianethic "Twitter Handle for Puneeth"). Or, if you’d prefer, [send me an email](mailto:pk@puneethkosaraju.com "E-Mail link").
